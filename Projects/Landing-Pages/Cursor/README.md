# Building Cursor Landing Page Only By Using Raw HTML & CSS

This is assignment given by Sir at Cohort 2026 to practice HTML and CSS and Have some real practice on building and designing website layout . so I build this by looking (cursor.com)[https://cursor.com] landing page.

## My Steps

Our Hitesh Sir has tauught always look row wise , one component at one time . so There is no problem comes in building any website. so My first approach was

1. **Build Navbar** : In this section , I use `nav` semantic tag and download all the assets from the real website from dev tool. so

- I create first nav tag
- then I give 3 divs and use **flexbox** with **justify-space-between** which helps me to achieve this **navbar**
- I also use **position:absolute** in Resources link and make one div with more links that show when hover to resources link only

2.  **Build Hero Section** : This is main page so I used **main** Tag and from here all the sections that is visible in website comes here . I followed:

- I made two CSS files one name is **general.css** and another name is **style.css** . By name general contains reusable CSS Styles and style contains styles of sections .
- I made a **container** class that has **max-width:1300px**. It helps to keep the layout fixed at center padding on both sides. This helps in consistent layout of overall webpage.
- I also create code editor which show above of hero page by manually and It help me to practice more in Grid and make columns and place the code .
